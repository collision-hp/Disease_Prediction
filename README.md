# Disease Prediction Web App

A simple machine learning web application built with **Python, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn** to predict **Diabetes** and **Heart Disease** from user inputs.  
Models were trained in **Google Colab** and integrated into the app using saved `.sav` files.

ðŸ”¹ Streamlit â€“ An open-source Python framework used to build interactive web applications for machine learning and data science projects with minimal code, without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

ðŸ”¹ Scikit-learn â€“ A popular machine learning library in Python that provides efficient tools for classification, regression, clustering, and model evaluation, built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
